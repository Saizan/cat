\chapter{Conclusion}
This thesis highlighted some issues with the standard inductive definition of
propositional equality used in Agda. Functional extensionality and univalence
are examples of two propositions not admissible in Intensional Type Theory
(ITT). This has a big impact on what is provable and the reusability of proofs.
This issue is overcome with an extension to Agda's type system called Cubical
Agda. With Cubical Agda both functional extensionality and univalence are
admissible. Cubical Agda is more expressive, but there are certain issues that
arise that are not present in standard Agda. For one thing ITT and standard Agda
enjoys Uniqueness of Identity Proofs (UIP). This is not the case in Cubical
Agda. In stead there exists a hierarchy of types with increasing
\nomen{homotopical structure}. It turns out to be useful to built the
formalization with this hierarchy in mind as it can simplify proofs
considerably. Another issue one must overcome in Cubical Agda is when a type has
a field whose type depends on a previous field. In this case paths between such
types will be heterogeneous paths. This problem is related to Cubical Agda not
having the K-rule \TODO{Not mentioned anywhere in the report}. In practice it
turns out to be considerably more difficult to work heterogeneous paths than
with homogeneous paths. The thesis demonstrated some techniques to overcome
these difficulties, such as based path-induction.

This thesis formalized some of the core concepts from category theory including;
categories, functors, products, exponentials, Cartesian closed categories,
natural transformations, the yoneda embedding, monads and more. Category theory
is an interesting case-study for the application of Cubical Agda for two reasons
in particular: Because category theory is the study of abstract algebra of
functions, meaning that functional extensionality is particularly relevant.
Another reason is that in category theory it is commonplace to identify
isomorphic structures and univalence allows for making this notion precise. This
thesis also demonstrated another technique that is common in category theory;
namely to define categories to prove properties of other structures.
Specifically a category was defined to demonstrate that any two product objects
in a category are isomorphic. Furthermore the thesis showed two formulations of
monads and proved that they indeed are equivalent: Namely monads in the
monoidal- and Kleisli- form. The monoidal formulation is more typical to
category theoretic formulations and the Kleisli formulation will be more
familiar to functional programmers. In the formulation we also saw how paths can
be used to extract functions. A path between two types induce an isomorphism
between the two types. This e.g. permits developers to write a monad instance
for a given type using the Kleisli formulation. By transporting along the path
between the monoidal- and Kleisli- formulation one can reuse all the operations
and results shown for monoidal- monads in the context of kleisli monads.
